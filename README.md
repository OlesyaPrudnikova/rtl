# RTL: RunTime Library

RTL is a substitution of the C++ standard runtime library with some additional features. 

## About the Project

RTL is useful for making Windows native applications with extremely small size (several kilobytes) without other dependencies except WinAPI system libraries. It is implemented in header-only style.
